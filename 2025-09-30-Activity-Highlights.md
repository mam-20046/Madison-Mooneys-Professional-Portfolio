# Activity Highlights!
As mentioned in my first blog post, I want to highlight my favorite non major/minor related course and my favorite club at UCONN!
Two of my most interesting non major/minor courses were Environmental Conservation and Introduction to theatre. Both of these classes were not my usual choice but they ended up being a few of the classes that stuck out to me!\

##### Other Courses!
I enjoyed sitting in my lectures for Environmental Conservation, the professor was really passionate about her work and I learned a lot of new material I would otherwise not have learned if  I had not taken this course.\
The Introduction to Theatre class, was the class that really took me out of my comfort zone, both with learning something brand new and having to perform in class, but I'm glad I took the opportunity to take it while I can

##### Club!
My favorite club at UCONN is the University Ballet Company. I have spent 6 total semesters in this club, and it has given me the chance to continue a passion that I have practiced since I was young as well as meet some incredible people from a variety of differnt majors and backgrounds!
