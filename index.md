Madison Mooneys Professional-Portfolio: Welcome to my blog

Welcome to my Professional-Portfolio! Where I will talk about my college experience!

#### About me
I am currently majoring in mathematics with an minor in astrophysics, and graduating from the University of Connecticut in Spring 2026. I have taken many courses that have fueled both my liking for math and space, as well as other interesting non related classes at my time at UCONN. Additionally I am in the University Ballet Company and will be completing my 7th semester with them in the fall!
