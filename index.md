My First Blog Post: Welcome to my blog
---
This is my first blog post on my professional Portfolio. This is where I will share my experiences at UCONN!
Some topics I want to cover in future posts are: 
- math courses I have taken and ranked to my interest
- my favorite astrophysics related course and why!
- my favorite non major/minor course and club!

More updates to come!
